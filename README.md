# IP Converter

## Using the tests

Some example tests have already been created for you. You only need make them
pass. You can get started by running the following commands:

1) Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:wvmitchell/ip_converter.git`
2) Move in and install dependencies: `cd ip_converter && npm i`
3) Run the tests: `npm test`
4) Alternatively, run the tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5) Make the first test pass, then move on to the first skipped test

## Important notes
1) Other than unskipping tests, you do not need to alter the test file.
